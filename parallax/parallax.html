Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to be marry. There was a tradition that she had to be a real princess but that was very difficult to find.</h2>
</div>
	
	<div class="divthree"></div>
	
<div class="divfour"><h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">He travelled all over the world to find potential suitors, but none of them had all of the princess qualities he wanted. They all claimed to be princesses but it was difficult to tell. </h2>
</div>
	
	<div class="divfive"></div>
	
<div class="divsix"><h2 style="font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">Some were ugly. Some were stinky. Some were not very classy. So he&nbsp; decided to go home and moped in his castle since he was dissapointed that he did not come back with a wife.</h2>
</div>
	
	<div class="divseven"></div>
	
<div class="diveight"><h2 style="font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">A couple days later, a terrible storm came through the kingdom. Nothing could be heard over the thunder and lightning and the torrential downpour would not cease.&nbsp;</h2>
</div>
	
	<div class="divnine"></div>
	
<div class="divten"><h2 style="text-align: center">All of a sudden, a loud band was heard at the door of the castle, the king, queen, and prince all jumped but the king had decided to open it gingerly in case it was an intruder.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
</div>
	
	<div class="diveleven"></div>
	
<div class="divtwelve"><h2 style="font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">The king shut he eyes but when he had opened them, he saw a beautiful young maiden standing in the rain. She shivered as the droplets drenched her dress and her hair. 
	"Please help me. I'm a real princess"
	she said.</h2></div>
	
	<div class="divthirteen"></div>

<div class="divfourteen"><h2 style="font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">Well, we'll see about that, thought the queen. She went into the bed-room and took her time stacking 20 mattresses on top of each other and laid a pea at the bottom. "A true princess can sense the slightest abnormality" said the queen.</h2></div>
	
	<div class="divfifteen"></div>
	
<div class="divsixteen">
	<h2 style="font-style: oblique"> The princess was so tired that she was not shocked to see the pile of mattresses. Instead she flopped right on top of one. In the morning the queen and king asked how she slept.
		</h2>
</div>
<div class="divsixteen2">
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 900;"> "Oh, I had slept very terribly!" said she. "I was tossing and turning because my back kept hurting due to the uncomfortable lump on the bed. I have no idea what it was but it was quite formidable. How awful!"</h4>
	</div>

<div class="divsixteen3"><h2 style="font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">The king, queen, and prince's faces all gleamed with pride. As only a princess could sense something as small as a pea. Especially through twenty mattresses.</h2></div>
	
	<div class="divseventeen"></div>

<div class="diveighteen"><h2 style="font-style: oblique">The princess was also very beautiful and cordial during her stay at the castle so the prince fell in love with her and took her hand in marriage. How lucky he was to find a woman as wonderful as her.</h2></div>
	
	<div class="divnineteen"></div>

<div class="divtwenty"><h2 style="font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">In the end, the couple lived a wonderful life together and the pea was put in a museum to represent the love of the future king and queen. It has now become a sign of good luck and many people look upon it for their relationships to succeed.
There, that is a true story.</h2></div>
